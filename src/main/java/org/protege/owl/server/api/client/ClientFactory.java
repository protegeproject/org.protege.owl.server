/**
 * This interface describes factories that can transform an ontology or a server IRI and will return a 
 * Client that can talk to the server for the ontology or the server represented by the IRI.
 * <p>
 * There are three issues that implementations of this interface can hide.  First there is the question of what types of IRI's are associated with
 * which clients and servers.  For instance, an IRI such as "rmi-owl2-server://wormhole.stanford.edu:4875" is associated with an RMI client.  A developer could write 
 * code that is aware of this fact and knows how to initialize and use the RMIClient class but this type of code is fragile and clumsy because it will not keep up with new 
 * transport protocols.  A factory implementing this class can report on whether it can support a particular type of IRI and if it can handle the IRI it can handle the details of
 * creating a client for that IRI.  In addition this interface enables the ClientRegistry which collects client factories and will use the client that is appropriate for a given 
 * transport.
 * <p>
 * Second there is the problem of associating ontologies with their appropriate server and ontology document revision.  When an ontology is first downloaded from a server, the java code
 * that made the download can keep track of the server from whence the ontology came and the appropriate server document revision.  However if this information is to survive between jvm sessions
 * then we will need a way to persistantly store and retrieve this information.  One approach, which is what is currently implemented here, is ensure that when an ontology is saved to disk, this metadata
 * is stored in some nearby place where it can be retrieved when the ontology is reloaded.  In the future there may be variations of the current method and implementations of this interface
 * will hide and handle the details of that implementation.
 * <p>
 * Finally there is the problem of authenticating to the server.  In many but not all implementations this will involve a user interaction and depending on the context this interaction
 * may involve a gui or it may be done from the command line.  This factory takes care of the authentication so that the caller does not have to concern itself with this detail.
 * An implementation may also cache and maintain authentication tokens so that the caller can get the same client in different contexts without having to worry about storing live clients.
 * This cache is very important to the Protege implementation which uses it to interact with the server in on on demand style.
 *
